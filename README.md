## Introduction

Robotic arms are widely used in automated machinery. Many assembly tasks that are monotonous and do not require thinking are gradually being replaced by robotic arms. Once an execution sequence is input through a program, a robotic arm can continue to execute according to its instructions.

Regarding the above we would like to nourish young students' minds with programming ideas and projects like this.

## Enviroment

The micro:bit, in conjunction with Microsoft MakeCode, empowers learners of all ages to delve into the exciting world of coding and electronics effortlessly. With its user friendly interface, MakeCode enables users to create interactive programs for the micro:bit using a block-based coding environment. By snapping together code blocks, beginners can craft animations, games, and even IoT projects, while more advanced users can seamlessly transition to JavaScript or Python coding. This combination of hardware and software offers an engaging and educational experience, fostering computational thinking and creativity.
