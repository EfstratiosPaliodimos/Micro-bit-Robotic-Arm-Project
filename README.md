## Introduction

Robotic arms are widely used in automated machinery. Many assembly tasks that are monotonous and do not require thinking are gradually being replaced by robotic arms. Once an execution sequence is input through a program, a robotic arm can continue to execute according to its instructions.
Regarding the above we would like to nourish young students' minds with programming ideas and projects like this.

## Installation
